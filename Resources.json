      "history": "The College of Information and Computing Sciences is one of the premier colleges in the province for IT Education and services. It aims to produce competitive IT professionals and IT-enabled individuals who will encourage real innovation for the advancement in the digital era of the province and the country as a whole. The college was established in 1998 at MSC Boac Campus through BOT Resolution No. 35, s. 1998 as Institute of Information and Computing Sciences (IICS), a special program to offer Associate in Computer Technology (ACT). Believing that the province needs IT Human Resources, after two years, IICS was adopted as the School of Information and Computing Sciences (SICS), offering two emerging degree programs Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology to cater to the graduates of ACT. Bachelor of Science in Information Management was also offered in Sta. Cruz Campus. The Bachelor of Science in Information Management (BSIM) was renamed to the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) to adapt to CHED Memorandum Order No. 53 series of 2006. After a decade, the Marinduque State College had an organizational restructuring wherein two of the big schools in the college were merged. The School of Industrial Technology and the School of Information and Computing Sciences convergence paved the way for the School of Technology's birth in 2016. After three years of being together, the two schools parted ways due to another organizational restructuring and SICS was re-birth in 2019. In 2021, however, SICS was converted to the Institute of Information Systems and Technology (IIST) and became part of the College of Engineering, Information and Industrial Technology (CEIIT) together with the Institute of Engineering and Department of Industrial Technology to centralize the resources of these three into a single college. But once again, fate has plans for this institute and let it navigate its ship on its own. Finally, the former school was converted into a college, banning the name of the College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS). In 25 years of its existence, CICS has contributed significantly to MSC's mandates in Instruction, Research, Extension, and Production. Currently, both the BS in Information Systems and BS in Information Technology in Boac Campus are Level III Re-Accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), while the BS in Information Systems in Sta. Cruz Campus is Level II Re-Accredited. CICS has produced thousands of IT professionals serving in the province, other parts of the country, and even the global industry. Faculty and students are also actively engaged in research through various local and international presentations and publications. CICS also serves the community by providing relevant extension projects and activities. For the years to come, CICS still commits to giving what their stakeholders deserve through quality education and public service with their mantra, WORK IN SILENCE AND LET OUR SUCCESS MAKE OUR NOISE!",

      "history": "The College of Education at Marinduque State University has a rich history, with the university beginning as the Marinduque School of Arts and Trades (MSAT) in 1952, offering vocational and technical programs. It evolved significantly over the years, introducing the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE) in 1976 under the Professional Industrial Education Department (PIED), which laid the foundation for the School of Education. Through legislative actions, the institution transformed into the Marinduque Institute of Science and Technology (MSIT) in 1983 and later Marinduque State College (MSC) in 1992, expanding its programs. \n\nThe BSIE curriculum was enhanced into the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) with specializations in Industrial Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, further solidifying the institution's role in producing competent educators. In 1992, the integration of Marinduque Community College (MCC) in Sta. Cruz into MSC expanded the School of Education’s reach, incorporating the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd). \n\nThe college continued to refine its offerings, introducing Music, Arts, Physical Education, and Health (MAPHE) in 2006–2007 and launching the Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Music Education in 2009. With evolving educational reforms, the College of Education aligned its curriculum with CHED guidelines, offering BSEd programs with specializations in Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies; Bachelor of Culture and Arts Education; and Bachelor of Technology and Livelihood Education by 2018–2019. \n\nThe BEEd program remains housed in the Sta. Cruz branch, emphasizing the institution’s commitment to quality teacher education and academic excellence.",

                      In Academic Year 1975 – 1976 the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) Order No. 28 s. 1975 authorized the school to offer the four-year Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology Curriculum (BSIT).
                      During the term of College President Dr. Rodrigo G. Monterey Sr., a new organizational structure was created that paved the way for the merging of the two largest sections of the College: Engineering and Technology to become the School of Engineering and Technology (SET).
                      By AY 2005 – 2006, during the term of College President Dr. Romulo H. Malvar, Technology was separated from Engineering and became a separate School, the School of Industrial Technology (SIT) that offered a two-year craftsmanship curriculum, a three year Technician program and a four-year Bachelors’ degree.
                      During the term of College President Dr. Merian P.  Catajay-Mani, a new organizational structure was created with the School of Industrial Technology merging with the School of Information and Computing Sciences and became known as the School of Technology (STech), but by 2020, the Industrial Technology program was again separated to become what it is today, the School of Industrial Technology.
                      Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology are expected to become highly-skilled and ethically and socially responsible industrial technologists.

Initially offered at the School of Fisheries (Gasan Campus), the program was transferred to the School of Arts and Sciences (Boac Campus) in 2015 with 32 enrollees. The program was first headed by Assoc. Prof. Emma Cabildo. The pioneering class graduated under the School of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Natural Sciences (SAFNS) in 2019. BOT Resolution No. 25, s. 2013, confirmed the offering of new programs at MSC, including the BSES, which took effect in AY 2013–2014. The program was evaluated by CHED’s Regional Quality Assessment Team (RQAT) and was granted a Certificate of Program Compliance, effective AY 2019-2020. Due to the growing relevance of the field, the School of Environmental Sciences was created as per BOT Res. No. 12, s. 2020. Former MSC President Dr. Merian P. Catajay-Mani (2015-2020) designated Dr. Evangeline B. Mandia as the first Dean of the School of Environmental Sciences, beginning on May 18, 2020, per BOT Res No. 15 s. 2020. On September 1, 2021, the School of Environmental Sciences was renamed the Department of Environmental Sciences under the newly formed College of Natural and Allied Health Sciences (CNAHS). MSC President Prof. Dr. Diosdado P. Zulueta designated Inst. Christian Russel M. Rabi as the Department Head on September 1, 2021, per MSC Office of the President Memorandum No. 536 s. 2021. Recently, Dr. Evangeline B. Mandia was designated as the Dean of the newly-named College of Environmental Studies, as approved by MSC BOT Res. 33, S. 2023, which took effect on February 7, 2023, SY 2023-2024. Inst. Ronnel C.

      "history": "Back when this college was still the Institute of Criminal Justice Education, in assuring our clients and stakeholders of the standard of education offered by BS LEAd program, it was subjected to accreditation visits and is now Level II Re-Accredited Program by AACCUP, Inc. However, consistent findings of accreditation visits showed the non-issuance of Certificate of Program Compliance (COPC) of BS LEAd program due to non-availability of applicable CMO on policies, standards and guidelines for BS Law Enforcement Administration program. Hence, with the absence of these guidelines and the implementation of the Philippine Qualification Framework (PQF), the institution's offering of BS LEAd would place the program outside the PQF's coverage, potentially disadvantaging our graduates in terms of local and international recognition. Further, on 18 October 2021, CHED MIMAROPA Director, Atty. Joselito C. Alisuag, Ph.D., CESE, communicated his recommendation of gradually phasing out the program and to transition to one with PSG such as the BS CRIM (CMO. #5 s. of 2018) or BS ISM (CMO. #6 s. of 2018). With those concerns, on 06 February 2023, the MSC Board of Trustees, through MSC BOT Resolution No. 23, s. 2023, has approved the gradual phase-out of BS LEAd effective AY 2023-2024. Thus, the College of Criminal Justice Education was established at the beginning of Academic Year 2024–2025. It was created by virtue of MSC-BOT Resolution No. 122, series of 2023, which highlights the operationalization of the CCJE as a separate academic unit from the College of Governance. This was also in response to the recommendation and results of the CHED RQAT Visit – Report on the Result of Preliminary Assessment (RRPA) No. 006, series of 2023, which coincided with the opening of a new program, the Bachelor of Science in Criminology. This move aims to comply with the requirements of CHED Memorandum Order No. 5, series of 2018 – Policies, Standards, and Guidelines for the Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BS Criminology) Program.",

      "history": "The College of Business and Accountancy (CBA) of Marinduque State College (MSC) was formally established on February 6, 2023, through MSC Board of Trustees Resolution No. 31, s. 2023, as part of MSC’s strategic move to become a full-fledged university. CBA emerged from a series of institutional transitions, beginning as the School of Business and Management (SBM), which was officially recognized in 2011 and launched during the second semester of the academic year 2011–2012. Over time, SBM evolved into the Institute of Accountancy, Business Administration, and Tourism Management (IABT) and was placed under the College of Accountancy, Business, and Governance in 2021. The unit steadily expanded its academic offerings, introducing the BS in Entrepreneurship in 2005, BS in Tourism Management in 2007, BS in Accounting Technology (now Accounting Information System) in 2013, and in 2018, seeking government approval to offer BS in Accountancy and BS in Business Administration with specializations in Human Resource Management, Marketing Management, and Financial Management. The leadership of the business unit has seen a number of changes throughout its development. Ms. Amelia M. Merano was the first Dean of SBM, succeeded by Ms. Verna Liza L. Capina (2012 & 2016), Mr. Michael V. Capina (2013 & 2021), and Mr. Generoso E. Udanga (2017). The role of Associate Dean was initially held by Mr. Mark Rey U. Tan, CPA, and was passed on to Dr. Merryrose Red-Palma in 2022. In 2023, Ms. Verna Liza L. Capina resumed leadership and continues to serve as Dean to the present. These leadership transitions reflect the ongoing commitment to institutional growth, academic excellence, and program development within the college.",

The birth of the College, as School of Governance (SGov), is by virtue of MSC-Board of Trustees Resolution No. 15-B, series of 2020, approved during the 127th Regular Meeting held on May 7, 2020. Beginning Academic Year 2020-2021, SGov offers the programs of Bachelor of Public Administration (BPA), Bachelor of Science in Law Enforcement Administration (BS LEAd) and Bachelor of Arts in Political Science (BA PoS). Dr. Anne Grace Labatete, a graduate of Doctor of Government Management from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila was appointed to be the first designated Dean. Prior to creation of CGov, the program of Bachelor of Public Administration, per MSC-BOT Resolution No. 47, series of 2011 was first offered by the College in Academic Year 2012-2013 under the School of Business and Management. While, the program of Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in June 1993 when Marinduque Community College was absorbed by Marinduque State College by virtue of Republic Act No. 7319, with the program being offered under the School of Liberal Arts at Sta. Cruz Campus. BS LEAd, on the other hand, had its beginning on March 18, 2008 when the Board of Trustees approved the offering of the program starting first semester, Academic Year 2008 – 2009 through BOT Resolution No. 14, s. 2008 under the School of Arts and Sciences, Boac Campus. In February 2023, MSC-BOT Resolution No. 31, s. 2023 Institute of Governance and Public Affairs (IGPA) under the College of Accountancy, Business and Governance (CABG) was converted into a separate College of Governance. And, in 2024, the program of Bachelor of Science in Law Enforcement Administration was transferred to the newly created College of Criminal Justice Education. At present, BPA remain to be offered at MarSU Boac Campus while the BA PoS at the MarSU Sta. Cruz Branch. Its respective designated Program Heads are Dr. Anne Grace M. Labatete and Dr. Hilarion R. Elegado.",

      "history": "The School of Engineering started its operations in Academic Year (AY) 1986–1987 with 40 enrollees to the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. MSC was then known as Marinduque School of Arts and Trades. Upon its conversion into Marinduque Institute of Science and Technology through RA 377 in 1998, a ladderized Civil Engineering curriculum was offered with 44 first graduates by March 2003. Simultaneously, a ladderized curriculum for the BS in Electrical Engineering was also offered. In a ladderized curriculum, a student may opt to graduate under the three-year Associate program in Civil Engineering or Electrical Engineering. This ladderized curriculum was enhanced sometime in 2008 to contain additional skills subjects thus enabling students to opt to graduate with either a Diploma in a one-year Building Electrician Course, a Diploma in a two-year Industrial Electrician course, or a Diploma in a three-year Automation Technician course. Similarly, students can also choose a two-year Computer Technician course, or a three-year Electronics Technician course. In AY 2013–2014, the ladderized curriculum for the Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering was also offered, giving a chance for students unable to finish with an NCII TESDA Certificate as a Welding & Fabrications Technician or as a Refrigeration and Airconditioning Technician.",
